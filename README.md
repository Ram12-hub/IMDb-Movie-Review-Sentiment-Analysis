# IMDb-Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis and news classification using NLP and ML models (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest). Achieved 89% accuracy in sentiment analysis and 78% in news classification. Used TF-IDF, tokenization, and lemmatization for preprocessing.

# Sentiment Analysis and News Article Classification using NLP & ML
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze text data and make accurate predictions.

 Project Overview
1.** IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**
Cleaned and preprocessed text data using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Converted text to numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.
Built and tested models:
> Logistic Regression – 89% accuracy
> Linear SVC – 89% accuracy
> Random Forest – 85% accuracy
> Decision Tree – 73% accuracy
Conclusion: SVC and Logistic Regression were the most effective models.

2.** News Article Classification**
Preprocessed news articles by cleaning and tokenizing text.
Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical format.
